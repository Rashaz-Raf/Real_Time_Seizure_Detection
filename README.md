## Abstract

Wearable devices that automatically detect and predict seizures could be life-changing technology for patients suffering from epileptic seizures. This research aims to produce a Machine Learning (ML) model to detect seizures which can be used in seizure detection wearable devices. With the help of multimodal sensors like Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Accelerometer (ACC), accurate detection of seizure can be obtained. The system can analyze skin resistance and irregular heartbeats that could indicate an impending seizure. Overall, the research paper aims to demonstrate the potential of a machine learning model which can be used in wearable technology that can enhance seizure management and improve patient outcomes.

## Introduction

Epileptic seizures affect approximately 50 million people worldwide. Traditional methods for seizure detection using EEG or video EEG are often expensive and not viable for everyday use. Hence, developing a wearable device using machine learning models could be a paradigm-shifting technology in the field of epilepsy. This research aims to address the accurate detection of an onset seizure using a machine learning model trained on sensor data obtained from wearable devices.

## Proposed System

The proposed solution utilizes machine learning models trained on multimodal sensor data to precisely identify seizures in epileptic patients. The system collects information on physiological variables such as skin resistance, mobility, and heart rate using wearable sensors. The objective is to create a highly sensitive machine learning model capable of reliably detecting seizures in real time.

## Methodology

The dataset is prepared by reading and preprocessing raw data obtained from wearable sensors. Machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and MLP are used for classification. The performance of these algorithms is evaluated using various metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.

## Result

The study demonstrates the superior performance of the MLP classifier in detecting seizures, with an accuracy of 97.4%, precision of 94.8%, recall of 96.8%, and F-score of 95.6%. Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine algorithms also show promising results. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning algorithms in managing multimodal datasets and detecting seizures using wearable technology.

## Conclusion

Machine learning algorithms, particularly the MLP classifier, show great promise in detecting seizures using wearable device data. The results suggest that wearable seizure detection devices can significantly improve patient care and quality of life for people with epilepsy. Further research is needed to validate these algorithms in clinical settings and integrate them into healthcare systems.
